📊 SCORING ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS:

HIGH-SCORING GAMES (50+ Points):
• Total high-scoring games: ${highScoringGames}
• Percentage of season: ${((highScoringGames / games.length) * 100).toFixed(1)}%
• Best fantasy environments for skill position players

LOW-SCORING GAMES (35 or fewer Points):
• Total low-scoring games: ${lowScoringGames}
• Percentage of season: ${((lowScoringGames / games.length) * 100).toFixed(1)}%
• Challenging fantasy environments, favor defense/special teams

TOP TEAMS IN HIGH-SCORING GAMES:
${topHighScoringTeams.map((team, i) => `${i + 1}. ${team[0]}: ${team[1]} high-scoring games`).join('\n')}

⭐ FANTASY FOOTBALL INSIGHTS:

OVER/UNDER TRENDS:
• Games going OVER: ${overGames} (${((overGames / (overGames + underGames)) * 100).toFixed(1)}%)
• Games going UNDER: ${underGames} (${((underGames / (overGames + underGames)) * 100).toFixed(1)}%)

FANTASY ENVIRONMENT QUALITY:
• High-scoring rate indicates ${highScoringGames > games.length * 0.25 ? 'FAVORABLE' : 'CHALLENGING'} fantasy environment in 2024
• Best teams for fantasy production based on high-scoring game frequency
• Weather and indoor vs outdoor venue impact on scoring

STRATEGIC TAKEAWAYS:
• Target players from teams frequently in high-scoring games
• Consider matchup environment when setting fantasy lineups
• Weather games (late season outdoor) tend toward lower scoring
• Playoff games often have different scoring patterns than regular season

DRAFT STRATEGY FOR FUTURE SEASONS:
• Prioritize skill position players from high-scoring offensive teams
• Consider team pace of play and offensive philosophy
• Weather-resistant players valuable for fantasy playoffs
• Streaming defenses against teams in frequent high-scoring games

SEASON CONCLUSION:
The 2024-25 NFL season provided ${highScoringGames > 100 ? 'excellent' : 'moderate'} fantasy scoring opportunities with ${highScoringGames} high-scoring games out of ${games.length} total games. This data helps identify the most fantasy-friendly team environments and matchups for future season planning.

Fantasy managers should focus on teams and players that consistently performed in high-scoring environments while avoiding those frequently involved in low-scoring, defensive struggles.
